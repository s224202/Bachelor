# Bachelor Project Logbook
## Date: 03/02 - 2025
### Work to do today
- Set up code repository
- Find interesting articles
- Maybe find some data?
- Maybe write a little bit of project description
### General notes

### Comments and questions for supervisor
Figure out danish or english?

### Work done at end of day
- Repository set up
- Began reading "A comprehensive review"
## Date: 05/02 - 2025
### Work to do today
- Find more sources
- Write some state of the art, or motivation
### General notes

### Comments and questions for supervisor

### Work done at end of day
got a little writing done. Found the SELFIES paper

## Date: 09/02 - 2025
### Work to do today
- Write enough for the meeting tomorrow
### General notes
- ZINC20 has SMILES, InClh and Inclh Key, maybe generate SELFIES from SMILES, for 3 different names, See about getting IUPAC somehow as well
- Maybe do something with building a seperate encoder/decoder pair for each set, with the same encoding in the middle.
- One-hot encoding of SMILES strings? (SELFIES paper)
- IUPAC -> smiles via OPSIN (open source tool)
- SMILES -> SELFIES via tool from selfies paper
- SMILES -> IUPAC model is on github
### Comments and questions for supervisor
- Danish or english
- What dataset to use?
- Any good papers?

### Work done at end of day
- Found lots of good papers, including the first translation one
- Wrote a bunch


## Date: 16/02 - 2025
### Work to do today
- Write research questions
### General notes
Forgot to write logs last week. Met with supervisor and got a better idea for data basis. Defined objective better. <br>
Hopefully figured out language, waiting for reply from AUS <br>
Project description is getting there
### Comments and questions for supervisor
- What exactly is in the project plan (Gant chart?, learning objectives?)
### Work done at end of day
- made 2 research questions

## Date:17/02 - 2025
### Work to do today
- Make a plan for how to finish project plan this week
- opt. begin work on gant chart
- opt. figure out 1 more research question
### General notes
SMiles is more parsing than grammar<br>
explore diffrences where there is no 1-1 translation due to lack of knowledge <br>
there can be many smiles strings for 1 molecule
### Comments and questions for supervisor

### Work done at end of day
- Made extra research question
- Had good metting with supervisor

## Date: 19/02 - 2025
### Work to do today
- Define learning objectives. 
- Find template for gantt chart
### General notes
I can write in english
### Comments and questions for supervisor

### Work done at end of day
